    <p>I am from a large family of nine. I have four sisters and two brothers. In the family I am the fifth oldest and the third youngest. I grew up in a Hmong family that follows their tradition and culture closely. Thus, leading to really tight knit family with my cousins, aunts, and uncles. That was how my life was until I graduated from High School. After, graduating from High School I moved to Sacramento to attend California State University of Sacramento as a freshmen.The first and a half year of college was overwhelming. It was not until I decided what my major was going to be that college started to make sense. After seven years of blood, sweat, and little to no sleep. I graduated from California State University of Sacramento as Class 2018 with a Bachelor of Science in Microbiology and a Minor in Chemistry. </p>
    <p>I started working when I was in college in The Dining Commons at the Sacstate Dorms. I worked there for five years before giving it up because I needed more time to study. After, graduating started working at an Amazon warehouse in Stockton while I was in transition of looking for an opportunity for labatory position. That opportunity came six months after I started at Amazon. I was notify that a lab in Pleasent Grove would like an interview with me and the week after I drove up to Pleasent Grove from Stockton for the interview and was highered. After, handing in my letter resignation and a two weeks notice I started working at CSP Labs in Pleasent Grove. For a year, I commuted from Stockton to Pleasent Grove and loved working there. Due to an accident and the COVID-19, I left CSP labs and headed towards another subject that has caught my eye but I never had the time or knowledge to try my hand in. I have always wanted to try learning Computer Science. I then was lucky enough to join a start-up group called "Blackrain Technologies". Out of all the workplaces that I have worked at has all been fasinating and has thought me alot about myself.</p>
